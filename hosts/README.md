# Hosts

This directory contains all **host-specific NixOS configurations**.
Each subdirectory represents exactly one machine. The "default.nix" acts as the **entry point**
for that host in the flake.

## Structure
```text
hosts/
├─ silvermoon/
│  ├─ configuration.nix
│  ├─ default.nix

```

- Each host lives in its **own directory**
- flake.nix must contain the path to the corresponding default.nix

## Files

### `default.nix`
Main entry point for the host.  
This file imports:
- configuration.nix
- hardware-configuration.nix

### `configuration.nix`
This file acts as the configuration file for host-specific settings. Here, system wide modules can be enabled/disabled. If you want to create your own host, you can use the provided template.

### `hardware-configuration.nix`
This is generated by NixOS. DO NOT TOUCH THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
